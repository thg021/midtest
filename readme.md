# Test Midtest

This is the response for the Node development test. The application is a set of TypeScript modules that perform various mathematical and logical operations. Below are the available modules in the application:

## Available Modules

1. **calculator**: This module contains functions to perform basic calculator operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **gradeCalculator**: In this module, you will find functions to calculate grades or averages based on assessment scores.

3. **multiplicationTable**: Here, functions are implemented to generate multiplication tables.

4. **palindrome**: This module provides functions to check if a word is a palindrome, i.e., it can be read the same way from left to right and from right to left.

5. **primeNumber**: In this module, you will find functions to check if a number is prime or not.

6. **vowel**: Here, there are functions to count the number of vowels in a given word or phrase.

7. **factorial**: This module contains functions to calculate the factorial of an integer.

8. **investmentCalculator**: In this module, you will find functions to calculate investment returns based on interest rates and periods.

## How to Run the Application

To run the application, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. Also, make sure to have all the necessary dependencies installed by running the following command in the project directory:

```
npm install
```

After installing the dependencies, you can execute the application using the following command:

```
npm run cli
```

This command will run the application through the "cli" script defined in the package.json, which is the file `tsx src/application/cli/index.ts`.

## Available Scripts

Here are some scripts defined in the package.json that can be useful during the development of the application:

- `npm test`: Runs the tests using "vitest".

- `npm run test:watch`: Runs the tests in continuous observation mode.

## Author

The "midtest" application was developed by Thiago da Silva.

## Final Remarks

This is a demonstration application that contains various modules with different functionalities. Feel free to explore the modules and understand how they work. If you want to make changes or add new features, remember to keep the tests up to date and ensure that everything continues to work correctly. I hope this application proves to be useful as a reference for future projects!
